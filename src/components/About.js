                <h5>Hello! My name is Ben Harter-Murphy and I am Full Stack Web Developer with a focus on Front End Development and Design.</h5>
                <h5>I was first introduced to programming and design while I was employed as a recruiter in Philadelphia. I was fascinated by their work and how they got their ideas from concept to a literal webpage.
                    Unfortunately due to the pandemic alot of us were let go. But then my curiousity kicked in. I started taking minimal courses on HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, after that I was hooked. That's when I made the 
                    decision to attend the Online Software Engineering Programming at Flatiron School and delve deeper into Programming.
                </h5>
                <h5>
                    While attending Flatiron we progressed through five modules, starting in the Back End with Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Then by the fifth module we were building Full Stack Web Applications
                    with a JavaScript(ES6) Front End with a React library.
